        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/Utah-CS" target="_blank">ECEP Web Dashboard</a></h2>
        <p>June 2023 - December 2023</p>
        <p>
            This is a web dashboard built using React, TypeScript, MaterialUI, and more. It is a new and improved dashboard
            based on the <a href="https://github.com/haihan-lin/Utah-CS" target="_blank">original repository</a>. It shows statistics on 9-12th grade computing education in Utah,
            showing various demographic, district, and course data. It is built for the Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance,
            which strives to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing education. The dashboard aims
            to provide transparent data on computing enrollment.

            I chose to highlight this project because of the kind of work I did. I was the developer
            on a team collaborating and giving feedback on the dashboard. I would then figure out the best way to fix bugs
            and add new features using documentation of the technologies used. I would even propose and implement my own
            ideas of how to make the dashboard more user friendly and functional based on what I saw from the interface and code.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/summer-research-2022" target="_blank">Database Creation</a></h2>
        <p>June 2022 - July 2022</p>
        <p>
            This is a project where the task was to find interesting real-world data to build a relational SQL database.
            I worked with a classmate and a faculty member to find and import data to a MySQL database. There were two
            databases I built from that external data. My classmate and I helped each other with looking for datasets and
            importing them to an SQL server.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to highlight this project because of the flights dataset that I ended up choosing (see GitHub repository for more info).
            There had to be information that was informative and interesting from a global perspective. After much research, I found
            public real-world data on international flights that were already in spreadsheets (see GitHub repository for data sources).
            Then, there needed to be an entity-relationship diagram to understand how flight numbers, areas, etc. related to
            each other. Then, there needed to be some data adjusted to fit the model designed for a database. Once all of the data was
            in a relational database format, there were Python scripts I wrote to import the data into a MySQL database.
