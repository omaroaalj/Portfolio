        <h1>Omar Portfolio</h1>
        <h3>Welcome! Did you stumble upon my page, curious about who I am and what I do?</h3>
        <h3>Well, my name is Omar and I have been fascinated by computers since I was young. I was so fascinated that I got a Computer Science degree at Westminster University.</h3>
        <h3>To me, programming languages and frameworks are like screwdrivers and wrenches. Once I know how they work, they help turn ideas into reality.</h3>
        <h3>Did you ever need someone to make and/or fix a website? Well, I've got experience in that area. Need someone to dig into code to get an app working correctly? I've got experience in that too. Just take a look at my portfolio.</h3>

        <h2>Capstone Project: SpokeNotes</h2>
        <p>August 2023 - April 2024</p>
        <p>
            There have been times where I felt overwhelmed about taking notes? “When do I pay attention to the professor? 
            When do I pay attention to my notes?” These questions floated through my head as I tried my best to capture 
            important information. One day, I thought, “What if there was a companion that could help capture and edit 
            lecture information?” This is where SpokeNotes comes in. It is an iOS app that turns speech into text and records audio too.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project helped with multiple learning goals. I understood how to make interfaces more user-friendly through student feedback. The project involved me figuring out how to implement various features, and how to integrate code provided by Apple. I got creative with how to implement a feature where multiple recordings are played sequentially from a single note. The purpose of the app is to help students feel less stressed and capture information in multiple ways, improving accessibility in the classroom, for example.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/Utah-CS" target="_blank">ECEP Web Dashboard</a></h2>
        <p>June 2023 - December 2023</p>
        <p>
            This is a web dashboard built using React, TypeScript, MaterialUI, and more. It is a new and improved dashboard
            based on the <a href="https://github.com/haihan-lin/Utah-CS" target="_blank">original repository</a>. It shows statistics on 9-12th grade computing education in Utah, showing various demographic, district, and course data. It is built for the Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance, which strives to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing education. The dashboard aims to provide transparent data on computing enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to highlight this project because of the kind of work I did. I was the developer on a team collaborating and giving feedback on the dashboard. I would then figure out the best way to fix bugs and add new features using documentation of the technologies used. I would even propose and implement my own ideas of how to make the dashboard more user friendly and functional based on what I saw from the interface and code.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/summer-research-2022" target="_blank">Database Creation</a></h2>
        <p>June 2022 - July 2022</p>
        <p>
            This is a project where the task was to find interesting real-world data to build a relational SQL database.
            I worked with a classmate and a faculty member to find and import data to a MySQL database. There were two
            databases I built from that external data. My classmate and I helped each other with looking for datasets and
            importing them to an SQL server.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to highlight this project because of the flights dataset that I ended up choosing (see GitHub repository for more info).
            There had to be information that was informative and interesting from a global perspective. After much research, I found
            public real-world data on international flights that were already in spreadsheets (see GitHub repository for data sources).
            Then, there needed to be an entity-relationship diagram to understand how flight numbers, areas, etc. related to
            each other. Then, there needed to be some data adjusted to fit the model designed for a database. Once all of the data was
            in a relational database format, there were Python scripts I wrote to import the data into a MySQL database.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/miniJava" target="_blank">miniJava</a></h2>
        <p>January 2023 - April 2023</p>
        <p>This is a class project where I worked with a partner to develop a programming language similar to Java called miniJava. This miniature version of Java parses, compiles and runs code given. Tools like ANTLR and the Java Virtual Machine architecture were used.</p>
        <p>I chose to highlight this project because I have a deeper understanding of how code is dissected, compiled, and executed on a basic level. I learned more about how a computer works on a system level. In the Java Virtual Machine, for example, there is a stack that is used to keep track of values and other information about the program.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/Fruit-Rush" target="_blank">Educational Math Game</a></h2>
        <p>January 2023 - April 2023</p>
        <p>This is a class project where the goal was to create an educational math game for elementary school students. I collaborated with a team using Agile methodologies. The game was made using Unity and C#. What I implemented were the math challenges. A student would be presented with a simple addition or subtraction math problem. If they guessed the problem correctly, they would receive a point.</p>
        <p>I chose to highlight this project because of the collaboration using the Agile methodology. Our team would meet in class and discuss who would work on what. From there, we individually worked on our contributions, and then came together to put all of our contributions together. This process repeated across three releases of the game.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/omaroaalj/client-project-money-team" target="_blank">Charana De La Cruz Web App</a></h2>
        <p>January 2024 - April 2024</p>
        <p>This is a class project where the goal was to build a web application for a financial strategist named Charana De La Cruz with a team of developers and designers. She offers services such as “Retirement Planning,” “Alternative Investment Options,” and “Life Insurance Policies.” The app includes a “Contact” page where someone interested in Charana's services can send her a message. The contact info and message are stored in a database and Charana can look at the messages through the web app's admin page.</p>
        <p>The reason I chose this project was because of the collaboration not only with Charana, but also with the designers. I got to learn design concepts along the way. I learned how to explain concepts in simple terms, since not everyone I worked with knew about software development. I also chose this project because of the individual work I did to get the “Contact” page working. There was a lot of research and analysis on my part to make sure that the page functioned properly.</p>
